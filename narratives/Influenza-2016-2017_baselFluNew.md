abstract: "Influenza has caused devastating pandemics in the history of humankind. But, even without pandemics, every year the high morbidity and mortality associated with non-pandemic influenza strains have a major impact on individual and public health. Interactions and dynamics of influenza transmission events have been described across different scales: globally, across continents, on university campuses, and within households. Therefore, it has become pressing to answer one of the key questions in influenza epidemiology: how influenza propagates within a city?"

# [A Global View](https://nextstrain.org/community/appliedmicrobiologyresearch/Influenza-2016-2017/h3n2/ha?c=country&p=grid)

On the left, this slide shows a phylogeny of the HA segment of H3N2 viruses sampled between mid-2016 and mid-2017. The locations where these viruses were sampled are on the map of the world on the right. Our sequence sample covers every continent with a focus on Europe. The large blue circle in the middle represents the samples from the city of Basel and the surrounding areas collected during this study.
<br><br>
The other viruses were collected and sequenced by many labs around the world and made available in the GISAID data base. We are grateful to these labs and the GISAID initiative for enabling such open and global analyses through data sharing.

# [Zooming in to Europe](https://nextstrain.org/community/appliedmicrobiologyresearch/Influenza-2016-2017/h3n2/ha?p=grid&d=tree,entropy&r=country_europe&clade=root)

The 2016-17 European influenza season was dominated by H3N2 viruses from the 3c2.A group. In this study, we investigated the patterns of viral mixing and transmission on multiple geographic scales from the country to street level. 
<br><br>
We now explore these patterns by gradually increasing geographic resolution and begin by zooming into virus from Europe....

# [Influenza Diversity in Europe and Basel](https://nextstrain.org/community/appliedmicrobiologyresearch/Influenza-2016-2017/h3n2/ha?f_region=Europe&c=clade_membership&p=grid&r=country_europe&clade=root)

We have now filtered the tree and the map to sequences of viruses isolated in Europe, 665 of which are from this study were sampled in Switzerland (~300 non-Swiss European samples).
<br><br>
The different co-circulating viral variants are broadly distributed throughout Europe without any obvious clustering. Furthermore, the sequences from this study are a representative sample of European diversity.
