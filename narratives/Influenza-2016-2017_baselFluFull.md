# [Zooming in to Europe](https://nextstrain.org/community/appliedmicrobiologyresearch/Influenza-2016-2017/h3n2/full?p=grid&d=tree,entropy&r=country_europe&clade=root)

We will now zoom in to Europe...

# [Zoomed into Europe](https://nextstrain.org/community/appliedmicrobiologyresearch/Influenza-2016-2017/h3n2/full?p=grid&r=country_europe&clade=root)

A view of samples in Europe, coloured by country.

# [Zooming in to Cities](https://nextstrain.org/community/appliedmicrobiologyresearch/Influenza-2016-2017/h3n2/full?c=city&p=grid&r=city&d=tree,entropy&clade=root)

We will now zoom in to Cities...

# [Zoomed into Cities](https://nextstrain.org/community/appliedmicrobiologyresearch/Influenza-2016-2017/h3n2/full?c=city&p=grid&r=city&clade=root)

A view of samples in Cities, coloured by city. Samples from GISAID do not have city information, only study samples do.

I've improved this by removing cities in Italy and the south of Switzerland. I could tighten this up by removing more cities - it depends how zoomed in you want.

# [Zooming in to Quarter](https://nextstrain.org/community/appliedmicrobiologyresearch/Influenza-2016-2017/h3n2/full?c=quarter&p=grid&r=quarter&d=tree,entropy&clade=root)

We will now zoom in to Quarters...

Unfortunately city zoom is currently quite zoomed out (see previous city-level zoom step); this is the same zoom level used.
