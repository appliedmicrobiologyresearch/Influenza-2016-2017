abstract: "Influenza has caused devastating pandemics in the history of humankind. But, even without pandemics, every year the high morbidity and mortality associated with non-pandemic influenza strains have a major impact on individual and public health. Interactions and dynamics of influenza transmission events have been described across different scales: globally, across continents, on university campuses, and within households. Therefore, it has become pressing to answer one of the key questions in influenza epidemiology: how influenza propagates within a city? <br><br> In this study, we combined geographical and epidemiological data with whole genome sequencing of influenza viruses to achieve a detailed view of the socioeconomic factors associated with influenza transmission. We achieve an unprecedented level of resolution, tracking patterns at the level of urban quarters (i.e. neighbourhoods/areas) and statistical blocks (i.e. city blocks/streets), which corresponding to the smallest geographic subdivisions. These analyses revealed that net income was the major factor associated with influenza vaccination rates, herd immunity, and influenza incidence. During the following slides of the narrative function of nextstrain, whole genome sequencing revealed that strains in Basel reflect the global diversity at various levels from surrounding cities to urban quarters and statistical blocks. Also, the pattern underpinning transmission routes between different urban quarters is complex, but linked to low pre-seasonal herd immunity and net income within urban quarters."

# [A Global View](https://nextstrain.org/community/appliedmicrobiologyresearch/Influenza-2016-2017/h3n2/ha?c=country&p=grid)

On the left, this slide shows a phylogeny of the HA segment of H3N2 viruses sampled between mid-2016 and mid-2017. The locations where these viruses were sampled are on the map of the world on the right. Our sequence sample covers every continent with a focus on Europe. The large blue circle in the middle represents the samples from the city of Basel and the surrounding areas collected during this study.
<br><br>
The other viruses were collected and sequenced by many labs around the world and made available in the GISAID data base. We are grateful to these labs and the GISAID initiative for enabling such open and global analyses through data sharing.

# [Zooming in to Europe](https://nextstrain.org/community/appliedmicrobiologyresearch/Influenza-2016-2017/h3n2/ha?p=grid&d=tree,entropy&r=country_europe&clade=root)

The 2016-17 European influenza season was dominated by H3N2 viruses from the 3c2.A group. In this study, we investigated the patterns of viral mixing and transmission on multiple geographic scales from the country to street level. 
<br><br>
We now explore these patterns by gradually increasing geographic resolution and begin by zooming into virus from Europe....

# [Influenza Diversity in Europe and Basel](https://nextstrain.org/community/appliedmicrobiologyresearch/Influenza-2016-2017/h3n2/ha?f_region=Europe&c=clade_membership&p=grid&r=country_europe&clade=root)

We have now filtered the tree and the map to sequences of viruses isolated in Europe, 665 of which are from this study were sampled in Switzerland (~300 non-Swiss European samples).
<br><br>
The different co-circulating viral variants are broadly distributed throughout Europe without any obvious clustering. Furthermore, the sequences from this study are a representative sample of European diversity.

# [Zooming in to NE Switzerland](https://nextstrain.org/community/appliedmicrobiologyresearch/Influenza-2016-2017/h3n2/ha?f_region=Europe&f_country=Germany,Switzerland,France&c=city&p=grid&r=city&d=tree,entropy&clade=root)

In the 2016-17 season we performed a study specifically exploring isolates from the Basel area. We can now zoom in to the north-eastern part of Switzerland.

# [Geographic Distribution of Study participants](https://nextstrain.org/community/appliedmicrobiologyresearch/Influenza-2016-2017/h3n2/ha?f_region=Europe&f_country=Germany,Switzerland,France&c=city&p=grid&r=city&clade=root)

Basel is the regional hub, with ~175,000 inhabitants, and with thousands of people communiting into the city every day from surrounding areas. This is reflected by the sample distribution we have sequenced, where most sequences (60%) are from Basel. The locations of the samples are plotted in the city of residence.
<br><br>
Samples from GISAID do not have city information, only study samples do.

# [Zooming in to Urban Quarter](https://nextstrain.org/community/appliedmicrobiologyresearch/Influenza-2016-2017/h3n2/ha?c=quarter&f_city=Basel&p=grid&r=quarter&d=tree,entropy&clade=root)

A central question of this study is the micro-epidemiology and transmission within a city. Therefore we will now increase geographic resolution to Urban Quarters within the City of Basel.

# [Virus Diversity at the Urban Quarter Level](https://nextstrain.org/community/appliedmicrobiologyresearch/Influenza-2016-2017/h3n2/ha?c=quarter&f_city=Basel&p=grid&r=quarter&clade=root)

Even at this fine geographic scale, we find multiple virus variants in most urban quarters of the city, indicating frequent exchange of viruses with Europe and the rest of the world.
<br><br>
The number of independent introductions of influenza viruses into Basel is investigated at greater length in Mueller N., et al. (submitted).
<br><br>
Only study samples within Basel have urban quarter information.

# [Influenza Diversity and Socio-Economic Patterns](https://nextstrain.org/community/appliedmicrobiologyresearch/Influenza-2016-2017/h3n2/ha?c=Social_Score_sum&f_city=Basel&p=grid&r=quarter&clade=root)

The urban quarters of Basel differ substantially in their socio-economic structure -- quantified here as a score accounting for population density, income, and living space. (3 being the highest density, lowest income, and lowest living space.)
<br><br>
While the statistical analysis presented in the article showed that influenza incidence depends on socio-economic factors, there doesn't seem be an obvious association between socio-economic status and viral variants. Most viral variants are present in poor and rich urban quarters alike.

# [Zooming in to Statistical Block...](https://nextstrain.org/community/appliedmicrobiologyresearch/Influenza-2016-2017/h3n2/ha?c=Einwohner_proHektare_Klassifiziert&f_city=Bettingen,Riehen,Basel&d=tree,entropy&r=block&clade=root)

Thanks to the extraordinary efforts from the Geography Institute at the University of Basel and the official records of the City of Basel, we have detailed socio-economic data at the statistical block level. 
<br><br>
Increasing the geographical resolution further, we can investigate socio-economic determinants at the micro scale.

# [Even Geographical Distribution of Flu Cases](https://nextstrain.org/community/appliedmicrobiologyresearch/Influenza-2016-2017/h3n2/ha?c=Einwohner_proHektare_Klassifiziert&f_city=Bettingen,Riehen,Basel&r=block&clade=root)

The city of Basel has 1,078 statistical blocks, with a mean number of inhabitants of 185. During 2016-2017, we found between 0 and 11 flu cases per block. A third of the statistical blocks (309/1,078) had at least one sampled case of influenza during 2016-2017.
<br><br>
Colouring the tree and map by population density (with 1 being highest density), we can see sharp boundaries between different areas of Basel which coincide with the boundaries between quarters.
<br><br>
Even at the level of statistical blocks, there is little gegraphical clustering of related viral variants.

Statistical block
<br>
Even at resolution of statistical blocks, there is high diversity of isolates. In a single block, multiple different viruses which belong to different clusters, can occur.
