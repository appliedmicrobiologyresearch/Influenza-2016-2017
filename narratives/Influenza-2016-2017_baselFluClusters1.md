# [Cluster 53](https://nextstrain.org/community/appliedmicrobiologyresearch/Influenza-2016-2017/h3n2/full?c=quarter&clade=Cluster_53&p=grid&r=block)

This cluster is mainly located in the Gundelingen area. This first cluster has 4 quarters involved, with most of the cases in the Gundeli area.
<br><br>
The grey sequence is from just across the border in Lorrach.

# [Cluster 31](https://nextstrain.org/community/appliedmicrobiologyresearch/Influenza-2016-2017/h3n2/full?c=zoom_cluster&clade=Cluster_31&p=grid&r=block)

This cluster is a more geographically more diverse, with one sample from Brazil. Multiple cities surrounding Basel and several Quarters are also involved. The Brazil sequence might be located outside of this cluster.

# [Cluster 19](https://nextstrain.org/community/appliedmicrobiologyresearch/Influenza-2016-2017/h3n2/full?c=zoom_cluster&clade=Cluster_19&p=grid&r=block)

This cluster is also found all over Basel, and is the largest we show here.
<br><br>
The three samples shown at the bottom of this clade have reassorted at least one of their segments.

We can illustrate that this cluster extends outside of basel by zooming to the city level

# [Cluster 19 by City](https://nextstrain.org/community/appliedmicrobiologyresearch/Influenza-2016-2017/h3n2/full?c=zoom_cluster&clade=Cluster_19&p=grid&r=city)

It's now clear that other sequences from this Cluster are from cities nearby basel.
