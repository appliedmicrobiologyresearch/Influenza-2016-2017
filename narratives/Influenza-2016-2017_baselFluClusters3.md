abstract: "As examples of transmission within the city, here we show three putative transmission clusters at the resolution provided by using whole-genomes."

# [Why Full Genomes](https://nextstrain.org/community/appliedmicrobiologyresearch/Influenza-2016-2017/h3n2/full?c=block&f_city=Basel&p=grid&r=block)

What is the advantage of using whole genomes rather than one segment, as previously?
<br><br>
The rate at which mutations accumulate over the whole genome is faster, giving us greater resolution.
<br><br>
However, if segments have reassorted, this can skew our phylogenetic reconstruction. Here, due to the potential effects of reassortment particularly on the deeper tree reconstruction, we present a divergence phylogeny rather than a time-resolved phylogeny.

# [Cluster 53](https://nextstrain.org/community/appliedmicrobiologyresearch/Influenza-2016-2017/h3n2/full?c=quarter&clade=Cluster_53&p=grid&r=block)

Cluster 53 is mainly located in the Gundeldingen area. This first cluster has 4 quarters involved, with most of the cases in the Gundeldingen area.
<br><br>
The grey sequence is from just across the border in Lorrach.

# [Cluster 31](https://nextstrain.org/community/appliedmicrobiologyresearch/Influenza-2016-2017/h3n2/full?c=quarter&clade=Cluster_31&p=grid&r=block)

Cluster 31 is a more geographically more diverse, with multiple cities surrounding Basel (grey sequences starting with '35', not shown on map) and several urban quarters involved. 
<br>
There is also one sample from Brazil ('A/Amapa/146418-IEC/2017'), but this sequence might be located outside of the cluster (there is not enough genetic resolution to tell).

# [Cluster 19](https://nextstrain.org/community/appliedmicrobiologyresearch/Influenza-2016-2017/h3n2/full?c=quarter&clade=Cluster_19&p=grid&r=block)

Cluster 19 is also found all over Basel, and is the largest we show here.
<br><br>
The three samples shown at the bottom of this clade, on very long branches, have reassorted at least one of their segments.

We can illustrate how cluster 19 extends outside of Basel by zooming to the city level...

# [Cluster 19 in the Surrounding Cities](https://nextstrain.org/community/appliedmicrobiologyresearch/Influenza-2016-2017/h3n2/full?c=city&clade=Cluster_19&p=grid&r=city)

From this view, it is now clear that other sequences from this cluster are from cities close to Basel.
